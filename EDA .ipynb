It feels sturdy and has magnets for the lid as well as the buds themselves. The case also has a satisfying click when closed :)- The buds are very lightweight and fit comfortably in the ears.- As soon as you pull out a bud from the case, it will get connected if you've paired with a device. As soon as you put it back in the case it'll disconnect. The magnet is strong and doesn't open when dropped :p- Sound quality is excellent for the price. If you connect with a device and the sound quality is bad or breaking, try closing any tabs/apps using the mic. Bluetooth headsets loose quality when mic is being used.- The percent displayed on the case is beautiful. Also very useful to know how much charge is left in the case. The charge left on the buds can be check on the paired device- The device works in mono or stereo, depending on how many buds are outside the case.- The box was sealed with shrinkwrap as well as two plastic seals, one on either sides.- There is one clickable button on each bud, which multifunctions as play/pause, accept calls, google assistant trugger, turn on/off, and reset settings- The mic quality is apparantly good as well, based on my conversation with a friend- With low to moderate usage these have lasted over 3 days now, with 100% on the buds and 20% on the case- BoAt also seems to have good after sales support. One of friends had had his headphones replaced a few times. And they have physical service centers available.All in all these buds are a bang for your buck10/10 would buy again\",\n",

I was so impressed & convinced with my decision of buying this instead of Redmi Earbuds 2C for ‚Çπ1,299.1) Case quality - Made of plastic. Looks premium but neither so good nor bad.2) Buds - They are so small & light weight. Buds size will be average for 20+ years age, but might be little big for people whose ears are small.3) Connectivity - Has Bluetooth 5.0, so no worries about connection loss, but common distance is 10m.4) Sound Quality - Sound is good but not so great @ this price range. Bass is decent, Trebles are good, mids & lows are Ok. Call quality is good without any voice break.5) Battery - Battery life is good, will give you around 3-3.5hrs playback on a single charge. Case give you 3 full times charging for the buds. Main highlight is the battery percentage which most brands doesn't give. Really good.6) Brand - Boat is one of the best brand in market for audio accessories. This brand never fails to give it's best for the customer. 1 year international warranty provided & service centres are good.Final verdict - Overall I would say if the buds price is ‚Çπ999 & your budget is under ‚Çπ1000, then definitely go for it. You won't regret buying it. But if this buds price goes over 1000+ then check for other options.Peace ‚úåÔ∏è\",\n",

However this doesn't reflect in the boAt records anywhere. The sound quality for this cherry blossom replacement was not upto the mark so I contacted customer care and they said they could not provide support for this cherry blossom replacement, provided by their own service center, as my model was supposed to be black in color. Telephone support was no help in this case, they even claimed that the replacement ticket filed by service center was for a cherry blossom model. So between their support and service centers, the end consumer gets taken for a ride.boAt is supposed to provide 1 year warranty however my 5 month old Airdopes are now out of warranty since they won't support their own service center replacements.The interesting thing I learned is that the 1 year boAt warranty is only on the original product, boAt can keep providing you faulty replacements for faulty original product, but after 1 year from original date of purchase they have no liability whatsoever.

Earbuds does not catch signal in curved paths.Overall, I had an average experience from this product due to poor bluetooth connectivity. But, I think that it's good value for money.

Case lead fills bit loose and very sensitive to scratches.Comfort:Earbuds feels bit pointy but it could be just me. And they DO NOT HAVE MUCH GRIP IN EAR. I have dropped them accidentally several times. They fell off easily even with moderate head swings.Battery Backup:It takes around 2 hours to fully charge the case. Earbuds lasts around 4 hours on medium volume. I got total back up of around 10 hours.Summary:If you are looking for budget ear buds I would suggest to go for this, But be careful people are getting refurbished/returned product. If you have more budget then 2k there are many better choices available.\",\n",
